Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows players to play against each other or against a computer player using a minimax algorithm.

Game Description
Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe is a variation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game played on a pyramid-shaped board. Players take turns placing their symbols ('X' or 'O') on the board,
aiming to form a line of three symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends when one player achieves this goal or when the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
